- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Joanmike
- ðŸ‘€ My goal is to learn as much as possible.
- ðŸŒ± I like code.

I was always curious to learn how to program. 
In fact, I was trying to learn many years ago, but I had to give it up. 
This time I'm more motivated than ever to learn again and not give up until I get it.

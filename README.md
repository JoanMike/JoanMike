- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JoanMike
- ğŸ‘€ I'm interested in learning as many programming languages as possible.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java

I was always curious to learn how to program. 
In fact, I was trying to learn many years ago, but I had to give it up. 
This time I'm more motivated than ever to learn again and not give up until I get it.

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Joanmike
- ðŸ‘€ My goal is to learn as much as possible.
- ðŸŒ± I like code.

Programming is my passion.
Even though my professional experience was not limited to programming, it helped me develop skills that now contribute greatly to my performance.
My ability to learn new subjects quickly makes me an excellent candidate for challenge-taking. 
Automating and simplifying difficult tasks is always my goal.
